# Education
### B.S. in Aerospace Engineering & Engineering Physics, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Expected May 2025
  * Tracks: Aeronautics & Spacecraft Systems (respectively)
  * Minor: Applied Mathematics
  * GPA: 4.00/4.00
  * Student Athlete, Varsity Baseball (2020-2022)

# Professional Experience
### Jan 2024 - Present: Undergraduate Research Assistant
  * [Engineering Physics Propulsion Lab @ Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University](https://eppl.us)
  * Summary: 
    * Received $15,000 in funding for the development of an autonomous, AI-powered system capable of conducting power plant diagnostics and reports using a Unitree Go2 EDU quadruped, added sensors, and Jetson devices.
    * Developed a ROS2 workspace for deploying low-level (locomotion) and high-level (navigation) control policies with Python and C++ packages, training all policies through massively parallel reinforcement learning with Isaac Lab.
    * Collaborated with team members to implement Nav2 using LiDAR and camera data, for autonomous 2D navigation.
    * Created lab [Website](https://eppl.us), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/company/eppl-erau-db), and [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/eppl-erau-db) for project demonstration and public visibility. 
  * Supervisor: [Dr. Sergey Drakunov](https://faculty.erau.edu/Sergey.Drakunov)

### Sep 2023 - Dec 2023 : Mechanical Engineering Co-Op
  * [Textron Systems](https://www.textronsystems.com/)
  * Summary: 
    * Developed detailed 3D models of mechanical components using Siemens NX, focusing on Product Manufacturing Information (PMI) and Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T). 
    * Strengthened proficiency in ANSYS through hands-on experience with linear static analysis. Gained exposure to nonlinear analysis, enhancing my understanding of material behavior under complex loads.
    * Transitioned legacy 2D drawings to modern 3D models, updating outdated specifications and integrating current engineering standards. Developed engineering intuition regarding material tolerances and welding practices.
  * Supervisor: Allison Mustain

### Jun 2023 - Aug 2023: Undergraduate Research Assistant
  * Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Physics Department
  * Summary:
    * Developed an autonomous, AI-powered, omnidirectional vehicle leveraging low-latency inference on the Jetson Nano and low-cost hardware. 
    * Authored a PD control algorithm in Python to maneuver the vehicle based on input from the AI object detection system to successfully capture a free-falling object, solely using image data. 
    * Conceived, modeled, and 3D printed various parts and mechanisms to house hardware and object capture systems.
  * Supervisor: [Dr. John Hughes](https://faculty.erau.edu/John.Hughes)
