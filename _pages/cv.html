## Professional Experience
* **Jan 2024 - Present: Undergraduate Research Assistant**
  * [Engineering Physics Propulsion Lab @ Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University](https://www.linkedin.com/company/eppl-erau-db)
  * Summary: 
    * Received $15,000 in funding for the development of an autonomous, AI-powered system capable of conducting power plant diagnostics and reports using a Unitree Go2 EDU quadruped, added sensors, and Jetson devices.
    * Developed a ROS2 workspace for deploying low-level (locomotion) and high-level (navigation) control policies with Python and C++ packages, training all policies through massively parallel reinforcement learning with Isaac Lab.
    * Collaborated with team members to implement Nav2 using LiDAR and camera data, for autonomous 2D navigation.
    * Created lab [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/company/eppl-erau-db), and [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/eppl-erau-db) for project demonstration and public visibility. 
  * Supervisor: [Dr. Sergey Drakunov](https://faculty.erau.edu/Sergey.Drakunov)

* **Sep 2023 - Dec 2023 : Mechanical Engineering Co-Op**
  * [Textron Systems](https://www.textronsystems.com/)
  * Summary: 
    * Developed detailed 3D models of mechanical components using Siemens NX, focusing on Product Manufacturing Information (PMI) and Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T). 
    * Strengthened proficiency in ANSYS through hands-on experience with linear static analysis. Gained exposure to nonlinear analysis, enhancing my understanding of material behavior under complex loads.
    * Transitioned legacy 2D drawings to modern 3D models, updating outdated specifications and integrating current engineering standards. Developed engineering intuition regarding material tolerances and welding practices.
  * Supervisor: Allison Mustain

* **Jun 2023 - Aug 2023: Undergraduate Research Assistant**
  * [Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Physics Department](https://daytonabeach.erau.edu/college-arts-sciences/physical-sciences)
  * Summary:
    * Developed an autonomous, AI-powered, omnidirectional vehicle leveraging low-latency inference on the Jetson Nano and low-cost hardware. 
    * Authored a PD control algorithm in Python to maneuver the vehicle based on input from the AI object detection system to successfully capture a free-falling object, solely using image data. 
    * Conceived, modeled, and 3D printed various parts and mechanisms to house hardware and object capture systems.
  * Supervisor: [Dr. John Hughes](https://faculty.erau.edu/John.Hughes)

* **May 2022 - Nov 2022: Boeing Career Mentorship Program**
  * [The Boeing Company](https://www.boeing.com/)
  * Summary:
    * Participated in the Boeing Career Mentorship Program, enabled connections with multiple Boeing employees in interested fields.
    * Developed professional skills like conducting informational interviews, networking, and communicating effectively. 
    * Deepened understanding of professional development and industry trends.
  * Mentor: [Luis Velasquez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luis-velasquez-7404058a/)
