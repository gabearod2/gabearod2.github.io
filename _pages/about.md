My name is Gabriel Rodriguez and I am currently a student at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, where I’m pursuing dual Bachelor of Science degrees in Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Physics, with a minor in Applied Mathematics. I expect to graduate in May of 2025, and I will be joining MIT's Lincoln Laboratory as an intern in their Controls and Autonomous Systems Group. I’m passionate about the integration of robots into society and I hope to contribute to innovations that make this integration smoother and more impactful. Currently, I am preparing for graduate school, where I hope to explore the applications of control theory and machine learning in robotics. 

Right now, I’m involved in several exciting projects:
- **AMIGO** at the [Engineering Physics Propulsion Lab (EPPL)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/eppl-erau-db), where I’m working on advanced autonomous robotic systems for powerplant diagnostics, training and deploying RL control policies.
- **ToppleBot**, my senior design project for Engineering Physics, where I am the software and communications engineer for a scalable robot cube actuated by momentum wheels.

You can find more information about these projects [here](https://gabearod2.github.io/projects/). When I’m not studying or tinkering with (*or screaming at*) robots, you can usually find me nerding out about jiu-jitsu, my second biggest obsession.
