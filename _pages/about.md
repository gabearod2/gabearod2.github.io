Hello! My name is Gabriel Rodriguez and I am currently interning at [MIT's Lincoln Laboratory](https://www.ll.mit.edu/) in their [Controls and Autonomous Systems Group](https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/engineering/control-and-autonomous-systems-engineering). I gradutated from [Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University](https://erau.edu/), with dual Bachelor of Science degrees in [Aerospace Engineering](https://daytonabeach.erau.edu/college-engineering/aerospace) and [Engineering Physics](https://daytonabeach.erau.edu/college-arts-sciences/physical-sciences) and a minor in Applied Mathematics. In the fall, I will be joining [Carnegie Mellon's Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/), pursuing a Master's of Science in Robotics ([MSR](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/education/academic-programs/master-of-science-robotics/)).  

I’m passionate about robots, and hope to apply classical and learning-based controls to enable their integration into society. 

You can find more information about my projects [here](https://gabearod2.github.io/projects/). When I’m not studying or tinkering with robots, you can usually find me nerding out about jiu-jitsu, my second biggest obsession.
