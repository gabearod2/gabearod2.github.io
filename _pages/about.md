Hello! My name is Gabriel Rodriguez and I'm a first-year [MSR](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/education/academic-programs/master-of-science-robotics/) student at [Carnegie Mellon's Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) advised by [Dr. Wennie Tabib](https://wtabib.com/) at the [RISLab](https://rislab.org/). Currently, I'm working on leveraging differentiable simulation and reinforcement learning to advance agile robot control. Generally, I’m passionate about robotics, with a particular interest in combining classical control methods with learning-based approaches.

Previously, I graduated from [Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU)](https://erau.edu/) with dual degrees in [Aerospace Engineering](https://daytonabeach.erau.edu/college-engineering/aerospace) and [Engineering Physics](https://daytonabeach.erau.edu/college-arts-sciences/physical-sciences) (minor in Applied Mathematics), where I won the Engineering Physics Outstanding Scholar Award. My past experience spans research roles and internships at MIT Lincoln Laboratory's [Controls and Autonomous Systems Group](https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/engineering/control-and-autonomous-systems-engineering), ERAU's [Engineering Physics Propulsion Lab](https://eppl.us/), and [Textron Systems](https://www.textronsystems.com/).

You can learn more about my experience [here](https://gabearod2.github.io/cv/) and explore my projects [here](https://gabearod2.github.io/projects/). When I’m not studying or tinkering with robots, you can usually find me nerding out about jiu-jitsu, my second biggest obsession.
