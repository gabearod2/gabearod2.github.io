Hey! My name is Gabriel Rodriguez and I am currently a student at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, where I’m pursuing dual Bachelor of Science degrees in Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Physics, with a minor in Applied Mathematics. I expect to graduate in May of 2025, and I intend to continue studying. I’m preparing for graduate school, with the goal of specializing in controls in robotics, particularly in the area of human-robot interaction. I’m passionate about the integration of robots into society and I hope to contribute to innovations that make this integration smoother and more impactful.

Right now, I’m involved in several exciting projects:
- **AMIGO** at the [Engineering Physics Propulsion Lab (EPPL)](https://eppl.us), where I’m working on advanced autonomous robotic systems for powerplant diagnostics, training and deploying RL control policies.
- **ToppleBot**, my senior design project for Engineering Physics, where we are developing a scalable robot cube with momentum wheels for control.
- **VerdeCommute**, my senior design project for Aerospace Engineering, where I’m leading the design of a short take-off and landing aircraft with distributed electric propulsion for regional air mobility.

You can find more information about these projects [here](https://gabearod2.github.io/projects/). When I’m not studying or tinkering with (*or screaming at*) robots, you can usually find me nerding out about jiu-jitsu, my second biggest *obsession*.
