Hello! My name is Gabriel Rodriguez and I am currently a student at [Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University](https://erau.edu/), where I’m pursuing dual Bachelor of Science degrees in [Aerospace Engineering](https://daytonabeach.erau.edu/college-engineering/aerospace) and [Engineering Physics](https://daytonabeach.erau.edu/college-arts-sciences/physical-sciences), with a minor in Applied Mathematics. 

I expect to graduate in May of 2025, and will be joining [MIT's Lincoln Laboratory](https://www.ll.mit.edu/) as an intern in their [Controls and Autonomous Systems Group](https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/engineering/control-and-autonomous-systems-engineering) this upcoming summer. In the fall, I will be joining [Carnegie Mellon's Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/), pursuing a Master's of Science in Robotics ([MSR](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/education/academic-programs/master-of-science-robotics/)).  

I’m passionate about the integration of robots into society and I hope to contribute to innovations that make this integration smoother and more impactful. 

Currently, I am preparing for graduate school, where I hope to explore the applications of control theory and machine learning in robotics. 

Right now, I’m involved in two exciting projects:
- **AMIGO** at the [Engineering Physics Propulsion Lab (EPPL)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/eppl-erau-db), where I’m working on advanced autonomous robotic systems for powerplant diagnostics, training and deploying RL control policies, and room searching for anomalies.
- **ToppleBot**, my senior design project for Engineering Physics, where I am the software and communications engineer for a scalable robot cube actuated by momentum wheels.

You can find more information about these projects [here](https://gabearod2.github.io/projects/). When I’m not studying or tinkering with (*or screaming at*) robots, you can usually find me nerding out about jiu-jitsu, my second biggest obsession.
