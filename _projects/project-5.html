<h3>Summary</h3>

    <p>
        Serving as the Academic Chair for <a href="https://eraushpe.org/" target="_blank">Embry-Riddle's SHPE chapter</a>, I started an educational research project based on my the <a href="https://gabearod2.github.io/projects/project-4/" target="_blank">AI Object Capture project</a>. Students are encouraged to contribute to the project, regardless of their experience of skill level. Currently, development is being done in systems integration and current ROS workspace can be found <a href="https://github.com/gabearod2/omni_control_ws" target="_blank">here</a>. Again this project leverages low cost hardware and will prioritize the use of rapid prototyping and computational efficiency to dock to other, moving robots.
