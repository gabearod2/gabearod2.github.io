<h3>Summary</h3>

    <p>
        Serving as the Academic Chair for <a href="https://eraushpe.org/" target="_blank">Embry-Riddle's SHPE chapter</a>, I started an educational research project based on my the <a href="https://gabearod2.github.io/projects/project-4/" target="_blank">AI Object Capture project</a>. Students are encouraged to contribute to the project, regardless of their experience of skill level. Currently, development is being done in systems integration. The current ROS workspace can be found <a href="https://github.com/gabearod2/omni_control_ws" target="_blank">here</a>. Similar to some of my other projects, this project leverages low cost hardware and will prioritize the use of rapid prototyping and computational efficiency to dock to other randomly moving robots. Check back soon for the updates about the work of SHPE members this semester!
