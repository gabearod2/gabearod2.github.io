<h3>Summary</h3>

    <p>
        The ToppleBot project builds off of related momentum wheel cubes like Cubli and REM-RC's Balancing Cube. This project is in partial fullfillment of my Engineering Physics Bachelor's degree, serving as my senior design project. We have recently written out Conceptual Design Report, which can be found <a href="https://gabearod2.github.io/files/topplebot_codr.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. As the software and communication engineer I am implemented a ROS based system using Micro-ROS to interface with the onboard microcontroller. Through this implementation, I am sharpening my skills in C/C++, controls, and ROS. My current project repo can be found <a href="https://github.com/gabearod2/topplebot" target="_blank">here</a>.
