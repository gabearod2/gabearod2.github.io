<h3>Summary</h3>

    <p>
        The ToppleBot project builds off of related momentum wheel cubes like <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/astrobee/" target="_blank">Astrobee</a>, <a href="https://www.wevolver.com/specs/cubli" target="_blank">Cubli</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/remrc/Self-Balancing-Cube" target="_blank">REM-RC's Balancing Cube</a>. This project served as my senior design projecy for my Engineering Physics Bachelor's degree. 
    </p>

    <p>
        As the software and communications engineer I implementied a ROS based system using Micro-ROS to interface with the onboard microcontroller, an ESP32. Through this implementation, I sharpened my skills in C/C++, controls, and ROS2. My current project repos can be found <a href="https://github.com/gabearod2/topplebot" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gabearod2/topplebot_station" target="_blank">here</a>, with support for publishing IMU messages to ROS and visualizing orientation in RViz.

<h3>Balancing Control and Visualization</h3>

    <p>
        To accomodate the new software stack and IMU, I had to write my own controller. In the interest of time, a simple PID with low-pass filters on the error quaternion was developed and deployed on the hardware. After quite a bit of tuning, we got a pretty nice demonstration:

<h3>Odometry System and Visualization</h3>

    <p>
        I also got an odometry system up and running, based solely off the IMU data. Modeling each corner of the cube as a node, I dynamically update their positions using the quaternion from the AHRS algorithm. Then, using the projected gravity vector, I determine which node is the "balancing node" which allows me to determine the translation from the previous balancing node to the current one. I can then determine the position of the model and it's orientation and display it through RViz. Initially the visualization updated slowly and often mispresented the system orientation. Through multi-threading I was able to combat the delays and get another nice demonstration.

        To combat latency, I split the Micro-ROS publishing and AHRS alogirthm into two different FreeRTOS tasks. The fidelity of the visualization system was gretly improved as a result of this change. I still am working to play with the various frequency parameters, for publishing and updating the algorithm, but the following video shows the recently improved results.

<h3>Odometry System</h3>

    <p>
        We start by defining the node positions in the body-fixed frame \( \mathbf{p}_i^b \). Nodes \( i = 0 \) to \( 7 \) represent the ToppleBot's corners, and \( i = 8 \) represents the center (origin) of the body-fixed frame. These positions are parameterized by the cube's side length \( l \), which can be adjusted to support an arbitrary cube size.

        During initialization, we acquire the first quaternion from the IMU, \( \mathbf{q}_{\text{init}} \), and compute its inverse as a correction factor:
    
        $$
            \mathbf{q}_{\text{corr}} = \mathbf{q}_{\text{init}}^{-1}
        $$
    
        All subsequent IMU quaternions are corrected using quaternion multiplication:
    
        $$
            \mathbf{q}(t) = \mathbf{q}_{\text{corr}} \otimes \mathbf{q}_{\text{raw}}(t)
        $$
    
        Node positions in the world frame are then computed using an active rotation via the quaternion-derived rotation matrix:
    
        $$
            \mathbf{p}_i^w = R(\mathbf{q}(t)) \cdot \mathbf{p}_i^b
        $$

        The "balancing node", the one determined to be touching the earth's \(xy\) plane, can be determined using it's difference from \(\mathbf{g}_{\text{dir}}\) in the world frame. First, we find the normalized vectors from the body-fixed origin to the node positions in the world frame:

        $$
            \mathbf{u}_i = \frac{\mathbf{p}_i^w - \mathbf{p}_8^w}{\left\| \mathbf{p}_i^w - \mathbf{p}_8^w \right\|}
        $$

        We know that in the world frame, gravity points straight down:
        
        $$
            \mathbf{g}_{\text{dir}} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}
        $$

        Our balancing node is then determined as follows: 
        
        $$
            i_{\text{balance}} = \arg\min_i \left\| \mathbf{u}_i - \mathbf{g}_{\text{dir}} \right\|
        $$

        Once the balancing node index \( i_{\text{balance}} \) is identified, we compute two key translations:

        <ul>
            <li>\( \mathbf{p}_{\text{bl}} \): the position of the body-fixed frame origin (node 8) relative to the balancing node in the world frame.</li> 
            <li>\( \mathbf{p}_{\text{bn}} \): the cumulative displacement of the balancing node in the world frame.</li> 
        </ul>

        If the balancing node changes from the previous time step, we calculate its displacement:

        $$
            \Delta \mathbf{p}_{\text{bn}} = \mathbf{p}_{i_{\text{balance}}}^w - \mathbf{p}_{i_{\text{last}}}^w
        $$

        and update the global position of the balancing node:

        $$
            \mathbf{p}_{\text{bn}}(t) = \mathbf{p}_{\text{bn}}(t-1) + \Delta \mathbf{p}_{\text{bn}}
        $$

        The translation from the balancing node to the base link (node 8) is given by:

        $$
            \mathbf{p}_{\text{bl}} = \mathbf{p}_8^w - \mathbf{p}_{i_{\text{balance}}}^w
        $$

        Finally, two transforms are broadcast:

        $$
            T_{\text{base\_link}}^{\text{balancing\_node}} = \left( \mathbf{p}_{\text{bl}},\ \mathbf{q}(t) \right)
        $$

        $$
            T_{\text{balancing\_node}}^{\text{world}} = \left( \mathbf{p}_{\text{bn}},\ \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \right)
        $$

        These transforms enable visualization and odometry within RViz, where the robot's orientation and position are expressed with respect to the world frame via the dynamically selected balancing node.
