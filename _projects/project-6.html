<h3>Summary</h3>

    <p>
        As a wannabe outdoorsmen (I never have time), I wanted to build out the bed of my truck to facilitate some adventures. Based on my research, I felt the best approach would be to use L brackets and adapters for T-nuts to fasten the plywood to the bed rail. To do so, I printed 3D printed adapters with ABS (in my backyard). I used ABS specifically so that they wouldn't melt in the Florida heat. Here they are, mounted on the bed rail.

        After printing those based on the T-nuts I bought at Home Depot, I went to Shell Lumber, where they kindly cut marine plywood to my liking. I then installed the pieces, this time in my parents' driveway.

        After that, I stapled and glued on the carpet, along with some patches for decoration, resulting in the final creation, seen below.
