<h3>Summary</h3>

    <p>
        As an aspiring outdoorsman (though I rarely find the time), I decided to build a sleeping platform in the bed of my truck to enable some adventures. The idea was to create a raised platform for sleeping, with plenty storage space underneath. After some research, I determined that using L-brackets and T-nut adapters would be the best way to fasten the plywood to the bed rails. To achieve this, I designed and 3D-printed custom adapters using ABS filament, in my parents' backyard. I opted for ABS despite its printing challenges, as the intense Florida heat would likely degrade even PETG. Below is a visualization of the T-nut adapter design in Inventor.

        After printing those, I bought some marine plywood and cut it to the dimensions of my truck. I then installed the pieces, this time in my parents' driveway.

        After that, I stapled and glued on the carpet, along with some patches for decoration, resulting in the final creation, seen below.
