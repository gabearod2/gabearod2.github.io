<h3>Summary</h3>

    <p>
        The VerdeCommute project builds off of related Distributed Electric Propulsion (DEP) aircraft like the <a href="https://www.electra.aero/" target="_blank">Electra Concept</a> and the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/armstrong/x-57-maxwell/" target="_blank">NASA X-57 Maxwell</a>, utilizing <a href="https://verdegoaero.com/" target="_blank">VerdeGo's</a> hybrid-electric powerplants. This project is in partial fullfillment of my Aerospace Engineering Bachelor's degree, serving as the first semester of my senior design project. I was the project lead, delegating tasks and keeping team members accountable. The following poster summarizes our project.

<h3>Current Status</h3>

    <p>
        Development of this aircraft stopped at the preliminary design stage. As the project lead, my role was multi-faceted. I had a hand in initial and detailed weight estimations, thrust model development, systems integration, and cost estimation. My main focus was on the thrust modeling, where I replicated the X-57's high lift propeller designs to maximize and estimate lift augmentation as a result of DEP. The MATLAB code I used to generate the propeller size, chord distribution, pitch distribution and location can be found <a href="https://github.com/gabearod2/hlp_design" target="_blank">here</a>. The following slide describes how they were designed.
