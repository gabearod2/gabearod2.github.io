<h3>Summary</h3>

    <p>
        The VerdeCommute VC-1 project builds off of related DEP enabled aircraft like the Electra EL-2 and the NASA X-57. This project is in partial fullfillment of my Engineering Physics Bachelor's degree, serving as my senior design project. I serve as the project lead, delegating tasks and keeping team members accountable. I am currently developing a thrust model for DEP aircraft in MATLAB. Stay tuned for a GitHub repo containing the relevant code!
