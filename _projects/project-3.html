<h3>Summary</h3>

    <p>
        The VerdeCommute project builds off of related Distributed Electric Propulsion (DEP) aircraft like the <a href="https://www.electra.aero/" target="_blank">Electra EL-2</a> and the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/armstrong/x-57-maxwell/" target="_blank">NASA X-57 Maxwell</a>, utilizing <a href="https://verdegoaero.com/" target="_blank">VerdeGo's</a> hybrid-electric powerplants. This project is in partial fullfillment of my Aerospace Engineering Bachelor's degree, serving as my senior design project. I serve as the project lead, delegating tasks and keeping team members accountable.

<h3>Current Status</h3>

    <p>
        After presenting our first design review to classmates, professors, and industry professionals, we are refining our design in preparation for our second design review scheduled for December 3rd. As the project lead, my role is multi-faceted. So far, I have had a hand in initial and detailed weight estimations, thrust model development, systems integration, and cost estimation. My current focus is on the thrust model, where I am replicating the X-57's high lift propeller designs to maximize and estimate lift augmentation as a result of DEP. Stay tuned for a GitHub repo containing the relevant MATLAB code.
