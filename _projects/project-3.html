<h3>Summary</h3>

    <p>
        The VerdeCommute project built off of related Distributed Electric Propulsion (DEP) aircraft like the <a href="https://www.electra.aero/" target="_blank">Electra Concept</a> and the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/armstrong/x-57-maxwell/" target="_blank">NASA X-57 Maxwell</a>, utilizing <a href="https://verdegoaero.com/" target="_blank">VerdeGo's</a> hybrid-electric powerplants. This preliminary design project was in partial fullfillment of my Aerospace Engineering Bachelor's degree, where I served the project lead. The following poster summarizes our project.

<h3>High Lift Propeller Design</h3>

    <p>
        My main focus (other than Gantt charts) was on thrust modeling, where I replicated the X-57's high lift propeller designs to estimate and maximize the lift augmentation induced by DEP. The MATLAB code I used to generate the propeller size, chord distribution, pitch distribution, and location can be found <a href="https://github.com/gabearod2/hlp_design" target="_blank">here</a>. The following slide describes how they were designed.
