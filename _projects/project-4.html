<h3>Summary</h3>

    <p>
        This project served as my first real introduction to interfacing with hardware. My research partner and I devloped a mecanum wheeled vehicle that was capable of capturing a free falling object using real-time object detection. Using a Jetson Nano with only 4GB of RAM, we prioritized computational efficiency. I authored a PID control algorithm in Python to enable the object capture capabilites. Our final report can be found <a href="https://gabearod2.github.io/files/omni_object_capture.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. I encourage other engineers to start with projects like this as they can snowball into much bigger passions and projects. Based on our work here, we were able to garner support for the purchase of our quadruped.
