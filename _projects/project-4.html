<h3>Summary</h3>

    <p>
        This project served as my first real introduction to interfacing with hardware. My research partner and I devloped a mecanum wheeled vehicle that was capable of capturing a free falling object using real-time object detection. Using a Jetson Nano with only 4GB of RAM, we prioritized computational efficiency. <br/><br/>
        
        Below are some videos of us testing the platform.
