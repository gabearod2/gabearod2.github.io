<h3>Summary</h3>

    <p>
        This project served as my first real introducion to interfacing with hardware. My research partner and I devloped a mecanum wheeled vehicle that was capable of capturing a free0falling object using object detection. Using a Jetson Nano with only 4GB of RAM, we prioritized computational efficiency. I authored a PID control algorithm in python to enable the object capture capabilites. Our final report can be found <a href="https://gabearod2.github.io/files/omni_object_capture.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
