<h3>Summary</h3>

    <p>
        This project served as my first real introduction to interfacing with hardware. My research partner and I devloped a mecanum wheeled vehicle that was capable of capturing a free falling object using real-time object detection. Using a Jetson Nano with only 4GB of RAM, we prioritized computational efficiency. I authored a PID control algorithm in Python to enable the object capture capabilites. Our final report can be found <a href="https://gabearod2.github.io/files/omni_object_capture.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. I encourage other engineers to start with projects like this; they can snowball into much bigger passions and projects. Based on our work here, we were able to garner support for the purchase of our quadruped.
