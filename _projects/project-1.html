<h3>Summary</h3>

    <p>
        As a part of the AMIGO project, I handle the RL deployment, ROS functionalities, and support rapid prototyping efforts. While this research project is loosely structured, allowing for exploration into my team's interests, our end goal is to develop an autonomous robotic platform for powerplant diagnostics. Our canvas is the Unitree Go2 Edu quadruped, where we have added a Jetson AGX Orin, 2D LiDAR, ZED X Camera, Raspberry Pi, and other equipment. With our additions, the robot can currently autonomously navigate in two dimensions, leveraging <a href="https://docs.nav2.org/" target="_blank">Nav2</a>. I have also successfully trained custom RL policies through <a href="https://github.com/gabearod2/IsaacLab" target="_blank">Isaac Lab</a>, and deployed them with my <a href="https://github.com/eppl-erau-db/go2_rl_ws" target="_blank">ROS2 deployment framework</a>.

<h3>Current Status</h3>

    <p>
        One of the tasks I was given was to develop a locomotion controller to tackle the open-backed stairs found in many powerplants. While the controller is not fully operational, I have acquainted myself with RL training principles, Isaac Lab, Isaac Gym, and RL deployment in the process. As mentioned above, I developed a ROS2 deployment of the RL policies that is now being adapted to facilitate 3D navigational deployment with object avoidance for safety. While the ROS2 deployment worked for initial locomotion testing, I am now working on a deployment framework through Unitree's SDK, in order to minimize delays. The initial deployment of a high frequency hopping policy (to combat delays introduced by ROS) is shown below.
