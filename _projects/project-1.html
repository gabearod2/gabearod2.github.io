<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
    This research project is loosely structured allowing for exploration into my team's interests. Our end goal, however, is to develop an autonomous robotic platform for powerplant diagnostics. Our canvas is the Unitree Go2 Edu quadruped, where we have added a Jetson AGX Orin, 2D LiDAR, ZED X Camera, Raspberry Pi, and other equipment. With our additions, the robot can currently autonomously navigate in two dimensions, leveraging <a href="https://docs.nav2.org/" target="_blank">Nav2</a>. Our custom implementation, mostly authored by my colleague, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jose-castelblanco-002640195/" target="_blank">Jose Castelblanco</a>, can be found <a href="https://github.com/eppl-erau-db/amigo_ros2" target="_blank">here</a>.
